> @about : DOJO is a development framework that allows blockchain projects to spin up, develop and launch dynamic NFT collectibles and web3 social communities in no time. It is compliant to the decentralised interactive asset standard (DIAS), wich allows dynamic assets to be built on multiple layers and let layers react to changes that occur via real world data feeds.
